Project 1
================================================================================

To test functionality, perform the following steps:
1. make sqlrefresh
2. make phptest
3. Use a browser to view "http://localhost:1438/~cs143/"

*If data has already been loaded into MySQL, only need to do 'make phptest',
 then browse to the url above.

If 'make sqlrefesh' is giving errors try:
1. make sqlclean
2. make create
3. make load


DONE:
* create.sql (still need constaints from last part of project)
* load.sql
* queries.sql
* query.php

TODO:
* team.txt needs Lui's UID (make sure formatting is correct)
* readme.txt needs Lui's name
* violate.sql
